        Upgrade complete! Please double check the files to make sure they look correct.

        This script will make changes to your project source code.

        Note: It's unfeasible to account for all cases and Jets apps.
        This script cannot perform miracle upgrades. It's a best-effort script,
        and the hope is that this script gets you pretty far and is helpful. ðŸ˜„

        Please make sure you have backed up and committed your changes first.
        Are you sure you want to continue?

      EOL
      unless agree("Continue? (y/n)")
        puts "Exiting without making changes."
        exit
